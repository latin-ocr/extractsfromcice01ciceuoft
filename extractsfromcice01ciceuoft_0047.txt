-20, GR EEK A NECDOTES. 39

28. Omnino omnes, 'in fact it is always the case that? clari et
nobilitati dolores, ‘great and notorious sufferings.'

20. 4. Obduxisset, ⁴ had quaffed off? He drank the poison as if he were
quenching his thirst with a pleasant draught. ‘Obduco’ is literally ‘to
draw over’: ‘sibi' is here to be supplied with it, the expression implying
to take not a mcre sip, but a long draught‚ so as to ‘ deluge himself’ with it,
as we might say. Cp. Virgil's expression, Ae. 1. 739

‘Tum Bitiae dedit increpitans. Ille impiger hausit
Spumantem pateram, et pleno se proluit auro.'

5. Sic e poculo eiecit ut id resonaret. As if he were engaged in the
game called κότταβος. (See Dict. of Ant. ‘ Cottabus.’)

6. Propino, ‘I drink to the health of Critias the handsome.' Cf. Xen.
Hell. 2, 3, 56 ἔπει ἀποθνήσκειν ἀναγκαζόμενος τὸ κώνειον ἔπιε, τὸ λειπό-
μενον ἔφασαν ἀποκοτταβίσαντα εἰπεῖν αὐτὸν, Κριτίᾳ τοῦτ’ ἔστω τῷ καλῷ.

9. Conceptam mortem, ‘the seeds of death?

10„ Cui praebiberat, ‘to whose health he had drunk.' ‘ Praebibo' is
coined by Cicero as a translation of the Greek προπίνειν.

14. In eumdem scyphum, ‘to drink the same cup.' ‘Vadit‘ is used

with ‘scyphum' by a zeugma. Poison was the regular form in which sen-
tence of death was carried out at Athens.

15. Eodem scelere—Theramenes, ‘by as unjust a sentence of his
judges as that of the thirty tyrants on Theramenes.'

16. Plato. The speech here put into the mouth of Socrates is translated
by Cicero from Apol. Soc. 3²-

19. Necesse est—duobus, ‘ for one of two things must be the case!

21. Migretur‚ impersonal‚ ‘one removes)

²4· Qid lucri, ‘how great a gain,¹ gen. of quantity, or acc. to Lat.
Primer ⁶ genitivus rei dimensae!

29. Ia m. The force of ‘ iam ' is, ‘ we corne now, when we reach this alter·
native, to what is much happier.’

33. Cum fide, ‘ with honour.' ln the Greek, εὐόρκως.

Mediocris, ‘ as but a small blessing.'

39. Tentarem, referring to his habit of cross-questioning all who laid
claim to whdom, to prove to them that they were not really wise. He had
mentioned this earlier in his Defence as one of the chief causes of the ill-will
against him, which had led to his being brought to trial and condemned. A
good instance of Socrates' method‚ with Cicero’s comment on it, may be seen
below, ξ 31.

43. Absolvistis‚ ‘ voted for my acquittal.' A majority only of the jury
(⁸ iudices ’) was required.

45. Eius res, ‘his interests.'

53. Neminem. Observe the emphasis on this word from its being kept
till last.

57. Suum illud, nihil ut affirmet, ‘his wouted way os asserting
nothing.' One form of what is called Socrates’ irony.
