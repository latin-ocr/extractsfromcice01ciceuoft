„25, GREEK ANECDO TE ς. 45

59. Quid est tandem quod laboremus? ‘What reason is there on
earth why we should be at a loss what to do ’θ’

60. Nihil sentiendi. See above on 5 20.

63. In tua potestate. He means that Perses could escape the disgrace
of being led in triumph by putting an end to his own lise. Perses was the
last king of Macedonia. who was defeated by Aemilius Paullus at the battle
of Pydna. 168 ac.

25. 1. Sed utilitatis—peccatur, ‘but it is in matters of state that
wrong is most often done on a false plea of expediency.' ‘Re publica' is
not used here in its more ordinary sense for the state itself.

2. In Corinthi disturbatione nostri, ‘when we demolished Corinth*
‘Corinthi ’ and ‘ nostri’ (gen. of ‘nos') are both dependent on ‘disturbatione'
‘nostri’ being the gen. of the subject, ‘ Corinthi' of the object. If turned
into a sentence it would be ‘Nos disturbavirnus Corinthum.' Cicero is re-
ferring to the capture and destruction of Corinth by Mummius, 146 Rc.
when all its works of art were carried off to Rome.

Durius z supply ‘ egerunt.’

4. Nimis imminebat Aegina Piraeeo. Pericles used to call Aegina
the eyesore of the Peiraeus, ἡ λήμη τοῦ Πειραιέως. The Aeginetans were
for long rivals of Athens at sea.

8. Exterminant, ‘ expel them from their territories‚' the literal sense of
the word, from ‘ ex’ and ‘ terminus! He is referring to such measures as
the Spartan ξενηλασῖα, a sort of ‘ alien act.'

9. Pennus. M. Junius Pennus in 126 B.c. being tribune of the plebs,
brought forward a ‘lex de peregrinis' or ⁸ alien act ’ ordering all foreigners
to leave Rome, which was opposed by C. Gracchus, but carried. Papius.
C. Papius proposed a similiar law in 65 B.C.

Nam is elliptical‚ that for which it gives the reason being omitted. The
Lex Papia contained a clause inflicting punishment on those who had
assumed the franchise without any real claim, and this Cicero considers
just. He means therefore, ‘I do not mean to find fault with Papius‘ law
altogether, for,’ &a

9. Esse pro cive—licere, ‘it is right to forbid any one who is not
really a citizen to use the rights of a citizen.'

12. Inhumanum, ‘uncivilised.'

13. Illa praeclara, i. e. ‘ sunt,’ ‘those are noble actions.'

Prae, ‘in comparison with?

19. obscuret, ‘eclipses.’

22. Cyrsilum. Herodotus does not mention this story, but (9. 5) he
tells a similar story of one Lycidas being stoned to death for proposing to
accept terms offered by Mardonius at the beginning of the following year.

28. Non opus esse.. Litotes, ‘it was undesirable.’

30. Subducta esset, ‘was hauled up on the beach.'

32- Necesse esset. ‘Esse' would have been more natural as ‘qu0’=
⁶ et e0,' and the sentence is really coordinate‚ not subordinate.
