23. Continentia, ‘the integrity,’ referring to Fabricius' refusal of the
presents and offers of Pyrrhus.

24. Duo propugnacula belli Punici, ‘those two bulwarks of Rome
in the l’unic war.' Cp. with the phrase, Virg. Aen. 6. 843,

Scipiadas, cladem Libyae?

0bserve, however, that Virgil is here referring to the two other Scipios, the
elder aud younger Africanus. Cnaeus and Publius Scipio were brothers:
Publius was Consul in 218 B.c., the year that Hannibal entered Italy. He
was sent to Spain to stop Hannibal's advance, but, being too late to stop
Hannibal’s crossing the Rhone, he sent his own army on to Spain under his
brother's command, and returned to Cisalpine Gaul to take the command of
the forces there. After the battle of the Trebia he went to Spain to resume
his proper command, and there he and his brother contended successfully
with Hasdrubal for six years, till in 211 Rc. they were both defeated and
slain. But they had done their work, having prevented Hasdrubal from
sending reinforcements to Hannibal during the critical period of his cam-
paigns in Italy. Publius was father of Africanus Major.

the nomina] commander in chief. Xanthippus was a Greek soldier of
fortune, who had come to Africa to take service with the CarthaginianS.
He pointed out so clearly to the government the mistakes of their generals
to which their defeats had been owing, that they entrusted him with the
direction of their forces, though leaving the noniinal command with their
own generals.

3. Iuratus, ‘under oath': the participle is used actively, as if it came
from a deponent verb. So ‘ pransus' from ‘ prandeo‚⁰ ‘ potus' a participle of
