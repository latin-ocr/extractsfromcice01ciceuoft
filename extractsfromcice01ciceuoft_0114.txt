÷÷98 NOTES. 25-

22. Relinquere navim. The ‘quid sit' comes before this, the infini-
tives being used as substantives: ‘ what is meant by leaving a ship.’

25. 1. Sanctum est, perfect passive of ⁸ sancio!

2. Dicerentur—essent. Observe these past tenses, dependent on a
principal verb in a perfect tense ; for ⁸ sanctum est’ is a real perfect, not an
aorist. But this is the true Latin idiom where the result or purpose which
is expressed by the dependent verb is regarded with reference, not to the
whole time represented by the perfect, but to the past act in which it corn-
nrenced. Thus here ‘Sanctum est' implies ‘Legis lator sanxit' (aorist),
which would of necessity be followed by the past tenses. They must be
translated in English by present tenses.

Arbitrum illum adegit=‘egit illum ad arbitrum,' ‘compelled him to

whereby the seller gave a kind of warranty that he had dealt fairly and
honestly by the purchaser. The sentence is elliptical. It means, ⁴ brought
him before an arbitrator, in reference to the words ‘quidquid sibi,’ &cs i.e.
