ADVERTISEMENT TO FIRST EDITION.

IT is hoped that a volume of Extracts from Cicero,
bringing together from all parts of his writings specimens
of his simple narrative style, will be useful for the middle
forms of schools, and help to supply the want that is felt
of a good construing book, interesting in itself and fairly
easy, to succeed Cornelius Nepos and Caesar, while at the
same time it will furnish a good model of style for trans—
lation into Latin of such passages of English as are usually
set to beginners. The Editor has also found the shorter
Anecdotes useful in teaching the rules of the Latin moods,
by making boys turn those that are in Oratio Recta into
Oratio Obliqua, and vice-versa. They are also well adapted
for translation and re-translation.

In consequence of the wish for short and cheap Text-
books expressed by some of the leading Masters of
Schools‚ it has been published in three separate parts, as
well as in one complete work. Each part is followed by
short notes on the passages given, in which the Editor
has endeavoured to avoid inserting anything which may
be readily found in a Classical Dictionary or Dictionary
of Antiquities‚ or other common book of reference, but
has sought to give such assistance as may help boys in
making out their author, and point out to them the
usages and idioms and points of grammar which it is
important for them to attend to, as a foundation on which
higher matters of scholarship may be built afterwards.
