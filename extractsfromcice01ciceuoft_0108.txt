Qod, qui—mitigatam. Observe that ‘ quod’ here is dependent
on ⁴ mitigatam,’ and not on ‘ animadverto,' the English order of the words
being this: ‘ animadverto tristitiam rei mitigatam [esse] lenitate verbi, quod

from opposite points have interchanged their significations.' ‘ Hostis· ori-
ginally means, ‘ a person entertained by another: being connected with
⁴ hospes,’ ‘ hostia‚’ &c.‚ but came gradually to mean first ‘a stranger,' ‘a
foreigner‚' then ‘ an enemy‚' whereas ξένος, originally denoting a ¹ stranger,'
being derived from ἐκ (ἐξένος), came in the end to signisy ⁴ an entertainer'
and ‘ a friend!
