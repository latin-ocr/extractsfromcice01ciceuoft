96 NOTES. 15-

describe the quality of affabilsty, by which great men are able to put others
at their ease with them, and meet them as equals without any appearance of
condescension.

32. Et in patre et in filio. The first was Marius* colleague in the consul-
ship, 102 13.C.‚ and gained, with him, the great victory over the Cimbri.
He was one of the victims of Marius’ butchery when he entered Rome with
Cinna, 87 8.c. The second maintained Sulla’s laws against the counter-
revolution attempted after his death by Lepidus, who was his colleague in
the consulship. He was one of the chiefs of the aristocratical party, and a
man of very high character.

33. Mancia, unknown.

36. Vindicavit‚ ‘ punished.'

Ne Xenocratem quidem: here, again, a different verb must be sup-
plied from ‘ audivi.’ Cicero could not have learnt anything about Xenocrates
on the personal authority of his elder contemporaries, for he died 314 13.c.
‘Accepimus’ or some such word must be supplied. Translate freely, ‘this
was the case, too, it is said, even with Xenocrates, the austerest of philo·
sophers, who was on that very account great and famous! The sentence is
somewhat awkwardly expressed.

39. Minime tamen vituperandorum, ‘ which are yet by no means to
be found fault with)

15.1. Haec: the arguments which had preceded on the thesis ‘that
nothing is good but what is honourable.'

2. Qae verbis—videntur, ‘which I think we are discussing with
more than sufficient minuteness.'

5. Aut auri—voluptates, ‘either of gold and silvei· to gratify their
avarice, or of pleasures to tickle their senses, or of fine furniture to please
their taste‚ or of banquets to delight their palates.'

8. Vultis a Romulo? supply ‘incipiamus’z ‘shall we begin with
Romulus?'

9. Tandem, ‘ I should like to know? ‘ Tandem' in a question gives it
energy, and often marks indignation or astonishment.

10. Isti, ‘your friends‚' the supporters of the opposite side of the argu-
ment. He here means the Epicureans, who maintained that pleasure was
the chief good. He is arguing against an imaginary opponent.

15. Qid egerit, ‘ what he aimed at.'

21. Patrem De cium; P. Decimus Mus, who devoted himself at the
battle under Vesuvius in the great Latin war, 340 Rc. The omens having
been interpreted to declare that the fates required the sacrifice of a general
from one side and an army from the other, Decius, when his men began
to waver, solemnly offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods of death. and
then plunged into the thickest of the enemy and was slain. His son
devoted himself in the same way in the second Samnite war, at the battle
of Sentinum, 295 Rc.

22. Devotavit, ‘ made them devote themselves:
