sion of the throne of Macedonia in the contests among Alexander’s generals.

18. 2. Iidem, ‘and yet would not make even the slightest sacrifice of
glory.’ ‘ Idem ’ is equivalent to an adversative particle, like ‘tamem’ when
the two things mentioned are apparently inconsistent.

12. Invidiam timens. Cicero here adopts Xenophon's account os the
battle of Leuctra (Xen. Heli. 6. 4, 5), that Cleombrotus fought, against
his own better judgment, sor sear his enemies should accuse him of secretly

the charge, which Xenophon was led to make through his partiality for the
Spartans. See Thirlwall, vol. 5, ch. 28.

than the instrument, to make a more exact antithesis to ‘a Zenone ’ in the
previous clause.

are the forms of oratio obliqua, yet the person os ‘dedissem' is that of

obliqua his own thoughts when he abandoned Zeno's theory, and ‘ satis
esset ¹ is equivalent to ‘ censebam satis esse.‘
