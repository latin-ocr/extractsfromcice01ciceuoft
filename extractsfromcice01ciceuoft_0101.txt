12. ROMAN ANECDOTES. 93

63. Scaurus. M. Aemilius Scaurus, the first man of note of the family,
a strong supportet of the aristocratical party, and an orator of some note.
Sallust, Jug. 15, gives his character3 ⁴ homo nobilis, impiger, factiosus,
avidus potentiae, honoris, divitiarum, ceterum vitia sua callide occultans.'

65. Bestiae. L. Calpurnius Bestia, consul 111 B.c., sent to take the
command against Jugurtha‚ but bribed by him to grant him favourable
ternis, for which he was afterwards tried and condemned. Scaurus was with
him as ‘ legatus! Possederat, ‘ had got possession of.'

66. Duceretur, ‘ was passing by!

67. Rapitur, ⁸ is being carried to buriaL'

Si potes esse possessor, ‘perhaps you can contrive to get his pro-
perty.' Cp. ξ 28, l. 36.

68. Appius. There is nothing of note connected with this Appius,
His full name was Appius Claudius Pulcher.

69. Lege Thoria. This was an agrarian law, passed sornewhere about
100 Rc. Its details are uncertain. Premeretur, ‘ was being assailed.’

Ab iis qui dicerent, ‘ by persons who said.’

72. Liberum esse. In two senses; (1) ‘without an owner,' (2) ‘free,'
explained by what follows.

73. Crassus. L. Lucinius Crassus, the great orator, Consul in 95 Ec.
There is nothing to identify the Piso here mentioned.

Silus testis, ‘ a witness named Silus.’

Laesisset Pisonem, ‘ had stated to the disadvantage of Piso.¹

74. Potest fieri, ‘it is possible, isn't it ?’

76. Toto eapite, ⁴ with full assent!

77. Ut se Crasso daret, ‘ so as to put himself in Crassus' power,’ i.e.
so as to give him the opportunity for his joke.

84. Cincius: see above, ii. 10.

85. Prodiisset, ‘ had got up to speak.’ In public assemblies at Rome
the speaker addressed his audience, not from the place where he sat, but
from a ‘suggestus’ or raised platform, to which he had to corne forward
(⁴ prodire‘). In the Forum it was called ‘ Rostra: from the beaks of galleys
with which it was adorned : in the law-courts ‘ Tribunal,’ whence the French
¹ tribune.' So at Athens the speakers all addressed the assembly from the
βῆμα, and παριέναι is used, like ‘ prodire,' for ‘ rising to speak ¹ as we should
say, and the speakers were called οἱ παρίοντες.

86. Cinciole. Diminutives of names were used either, as with us, as
terms of familiarity and affection, or, as here, in contempt.

Ut ernas, Gai, si uti velis, ⁴ wareS, Caius, if you wish to buy.’ Cai.
This is the real form of the vocative of the praenomen ‘Caius,' proving
that the word is really a trisyllable, and that to pronounce the ‘ ai' as a
diphthong is wrong.

88. Lepidus. M. Aemilius Lepidus, Censor in 179 B.c.

Equum ademisset, ‘had deprived of the rank of eques? The ‘ equus’
was originally always furnished by the state, :xnd called ‘equus publicus‚’
