5. 1. Legem frumentariam. By this law C. Gracchus enacted that

impracticable one. (Rom. Commonwealth‚ vol. 1. p. 99.)

2. Consularis, ‘though of consular rank.’

agreed with himself.’ Qui is the old abl.

against.'

5. Nolim tibi libeat, ⁴ 1 should not like you to take a fancy.' An-
other reading is ⁴ liceat.’

then any chest. From it come French ‘armoire‚' English ‘aumry' or
⁶ ambry.'

3. Sciret is subj. because ‘ in quo ’=‘ et in eo,’ and so the ⁴ quum’ affects
both verbs, the sentences being really coordinate.

5. H. S. the usual abbreviation either for ‘ sestertii ’ or ⁸ sestertia! See
Dict. of Antiq. under ‘ Sestertius.' Here it probably stands for 150 ses-

tempt him to such a crime.
