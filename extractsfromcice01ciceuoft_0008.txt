iv ADVER TISEMENT.

The Editor is unwilling to allow the complete work to
appear without adding a few words of acknowledgment
and thanks. He has derived help from the notes of
Mr. Long on the passages srom the Verrine Orations‚ and
on Cicero's letter to Quintus, and also from the Oxford
edition of the Tusculan Disputations; and for several illus-
trations of passages from the De Officiis he is indebted to
the elaborate edition of Mr. H. A. Holden. The translations
of sentences and passages were in all cases made previously
to any reference to other editions.

His special thanks are due to his friend, the Rev. Dr.
Mstchinson, Head Master of the King’s School, Canterbury‚

sor valuable suggestions and contributions to the notes on
various points of Physiology and Natural History in the
‘Beauties of Nature?

It may, perhaps, be well to mention that the selection of
passages is entirely original, and not in any degree borrowed
from any other work.
