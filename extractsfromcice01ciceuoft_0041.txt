NOTES.

1. 1. Roges—utar. This is a conditional sentence, with ‘si' omitted in
the protasis or conditional clause: it is in full ‘si roges— utar) This is a
common construction in Latin, with either ind. or conj. in the protasis, ac—
cording as they would be used if the ‘ si ’ were inserted. E. g. ‘ Rides, ma-
iore cachinno concutitur· (i. e. ⁴ si rides ’) Juv. 3. 100. ‘ Tu quoque magnam
Partem opere in tanto, sineret dolor, lcare, haberes' (i. e. ⁵ si sineret dolor ')
Virg. Ae. 6. 30. In English we usually substitute a question, ‘ Do you ask,
&c. ¹? ’ Observe that ‘ utar' is conj. pres.. not fut. ind.

Auctore utar Simonide, ‘1 should follow the example of Simonides!
⁴ Auctor' from ‘ augeo,' lit. ‘ one who makes to grOW‚’ is used for ‘ an originator’
in various senses: here, one whose example originates a particular line of
conduct in another.

3. Deliberandi unum diem, ‘one day for consideration.'

2. 1. Praeclare accusat, ‘ blames in admirable terms.'

2. Quod consectetur, ‘for courting,' subj. as being virtually oratio
obliqua, giving the reason which Philip assigned for his blame.

3. Malum ; used as an interjection‚ expressive of indignation. It is a col-
loquial expression, more common in Plautus and Terence than elsewhere. It
is always used with questions : e. g. Ter. Phorm. 4. 5. 11 ⁴ Qid tua, malum,

id refert? ‘ Plague on you, what 's that to you ?’
5. ‘Id agis ut—sperent? ’ ⁴ is it your object that the Macedonians should

hope ’.θ’ ‘ do you want to make the Macedonians hope P’

6. Bene ministrum et praebitorem: supply ‘ dicit) ‘ He is right in

using the terms “ minister '’ and “ praebitor.’' ⁹

3. 4. Interdici, here used impersonally with dat. of person, ‘ patribus,' and
abl. of thing, ‘ bonis! When used personally, it usually takes, in the act.
voice, (1) a dat. of person and acc. of thing, as, ‘feminis purpurae usum
interdicemus?’ ‘shall we forbid ladies to wear scarlet?' Liv. 34. 7: (2)
sometimes the same construction as here, as, ‘ Ariovistus omni Gallia Ro-
manis interdixisset· Caes. B. G. 1. 46. Translate, ‘as fathers who mis-
manage their property are usually deprived of the control of it! Observe
that ⁴ solet’ with an impersonal verb becomes also impersonal.

9. Sententiis iudicum,‘by the votes of the jury': the ‘iudices' at
Rome, and, in some respects‚ the δικασταί at Athens, who are here meant
by ‘ iudices: corresponded more nearly to our own jurymen than to judges.
See Dict. of Ant. v. Iudex.
