-19, ROMAN ANECDOTES. 99

7. A senatu re non impetrata, ‘not having gained their point from
the senate‚' viz. that they should be ransomed.

8. Unum—remansisse, ‘ but that one of the ten, who had gone back
into the camp just after he had started, stayed at Rome.'

11. Interpretabatur‚ ‘ he made out.'

ι 2. prudentiam, ‘ real soresight.' ⁸ Prudentia ' is a contractiori ot
⁴ providentia.'

14. Illud, literally‚ ‘that other story': in English we should say ‘ this:
i.e. the following.

15. Non quos cepisset. The subj. is here used with the relative
because it is consecutive, ⁴ not men whom he had taken‚' though the expres-
sion of consequence is less clear than usual.

18. Qum, ‘ although.‘

20. Idem, sc. Polybius.

22. Honestatis comparatione, ‘in comparison with honour.'

24. Plures, ¹ more than one,’ ‘several.’ He is here referring back to the
former story.

Eadem fraude, ⁴ with the same dishonest purpose.'

26. Omnibus ignominiis, ‘with every disgrace they could put upon
them.' The censors had four kinds os ‘notatio' in their power. ‘ Motio ex
senatu,' ‘ademptio equi,’ ¹ motio e tribu,' and ⁴ in aerarios referre.’ These
may all be seen explained in Dict. of Ant. under ‘ Censor.'

18. 2. Male pugnatum. A very sostened expression. They had been
led by C. Pontius into a defile (the famous Furcae Caudinae) where they were
at the mercy of the Samnites, and forced to capitulate.

7. Pax Samnitium, ‘the peace with the Samnites.' Cicero is misled here
by patriotic prejudice. The conduct of the Romans, so far from being an
instance of‘ honestas’ prevailing over ‘ species utilitatis,' is rather a proof that
⁴ the Romans were as regardless of their own individual feelings‚ as of the,
laws of justice and good saith, when either were setin the balance against
national pride and ambition.' Arnold, Hist. of Rome, vol. 2, ch. 31.

8. Suasor et auctor fuit, ‘not only supported but proposed.'

9. C. Mancinus. He commanded against Numantia in 137 13.c.‚ Q.
Pompeius in 141 13.c. In the latter case, the treaty he had made with the
Numantines was repudiated‚ without even the farce of surrendering him to
them.

11. Suasit, ‘ spoke in favour οἱ)

13. Honestius, i. e. ‘ egit,' ‘ acted more honourably.’

14. In eadem causa, ‘in the same predicament,’ i. e. he had been
defeated by the Numantines, and had made a peace which did not satisfy
the Senate.

16. Apud superiores, ‘with those who have been mentioned above‚’
i. e. Postumius and Mancinus. Auctoritate‚ ‘the superior influence.'

19. 1. Belli aequitas, ⁶ fair conduct in war!

Fetiali iure. See Dict. of Ant. under ‘ Fetiales.'
