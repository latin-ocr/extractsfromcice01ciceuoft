titles‚ ‘ Maj0r‚’ to distinguish him from Cato Uticensis, and ‘ Censorius‚’ in
commemoration of his famous censorship in 184 ac. He was Qaestor
under Scipio in his expedition to Africa.

7. Neque cessaret unquam, ‘was never utterly idle? ‘Neque’=‘et
non': as the ‘et' here = ‘ both' it is better omitted in English.

2. Ι. Quum abrogabat, ‘in depriving'; ‘quum ’ followed by indic. in
past time, because the action is simultaneous with that of the principal verb.

4. Principes, ‘the leading men of the State!
