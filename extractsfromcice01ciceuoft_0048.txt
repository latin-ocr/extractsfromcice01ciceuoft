40 NOTES. 20-

68. Ego vero—habco, ‘Nay, 1 thank him much?

69. Qui multaverit, ‘for inflicting.’ ‘Qui’ causal, and therefore fol-
lowed by subj.

71. Ut mihi—videatur, ‘so that 1 for my part think that one who
showed so brave a spirit must have been wrongly condemned,’ literally‚
⁸ condemned though innocent!

73. Quid nominem, ‘ Why should 1 mention?'

77. Simonides. The distich is given in Hdt. 7. 228

ὦ ξεῖν’, ἀγγέλλειν Λακεδαιμονίοις, ὅτι τῇδε
κείμεθα, τοΐς κείνων ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι.

81. Apud inferos, ‘in the other world?

83. Unus. Herodotus, 7. 226, tells the anecdote, and gives his name,
Dieneces. The other was, according to him, not a Persian but a Trachinian,
one of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, who had seen the Persian host.

88. Genueram. The plup. tense connects what th‘z mother says with
the son's death. ⁴ It was quite right that he should die, 1 had given him
birth for the very purpose, that,’ &c.

89. Esto, ‘ granted, you will say,’ introduces a supposed objection, that this
contempt of death was peculiarly fostered by the stern discipline of Spartan
cducafion, which is answered by the instance of Theodorus: cp. Virg. Ae.
4· 35·

96. Rern, in apposition with ‘ aliquid—dicendum!

97. De nihil sentiendo, ⁶ of the fact that no feeling remains after death.'
“Nihil sentire ' is to be regarded as a sort of compound verb, and so ‘ nihil
sentiendo ’ is the ablative of the verbal substantive. Except for some special
reason the gerundive construction is always used with prepositious, if the
verb is transitive.

99. In quo moritur, ‘in which his death is described? The ‘ Crito’ of
Plato.

101. Urgeret‚ ‘ was close at hand ': used here absolutely. The full ex-
pression would be ‘ urgeret eum: ‘ was pressing hard upon him!

102. Multam vero—consumpsi, ‘why,1have wasted a deal of pains
to no purpose.’ Socrates had been arguing that a man's real self was his
soul, which left the body at death.

105. Assequi, ‘catch.’

106. Sepelito. Observe the future imperative. See note on ξ 7.

107. Praeclare: supply ¹ dicit? ⁴ This was well said of him, sor he

not trouble himself about the matter at all.'
