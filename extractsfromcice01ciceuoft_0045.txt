-17. GREEK A NECDOTES. 3 7

¹7. Imprudentes, ⁴ unawares,' ‘ unintentionally.' The antecedent to
‘ quorum' is to be found not in the substantives preceding, but in the sentence,
⁴ If any one is guilty of any of these injuries :¹ so that ‘quorum'=not ‘ et
horum animalium,' but ‘ et horum animalium violandorum!

20. Lustrationes: cp. Hor. Od. 3. 25, ιι ⁸ pede barbaro Lustratam
Rhodopen.'

21. Excipiant, ‘ encouuter!

15. ·4. Artem memoriae, ‘ an artificial system of memory.'

Proferebatur, ‘ was being published.'

5. Traditurum‚ ‘would teach him.'

6. Ut omnia meminisset. Understand ‘ effecturum esse,’ ⁸ that it would
enable him to remember anything.'

9. Docuisset, ·had offered to teach him': he does not appear to have
accepted the man’s offer,

16. 1. Actio ‘ delivery': not so limited a word as ⁴ action' with us. ⁸ Actor'
is used at the end of the passage sor ‘ speaker ' (properly ‘ pleader,' ‘ is qui*
causam agit'), and so ‘ actio· is the delivery of a speech, with all its accom-
paniments of tone, look, gesture.

Una dominatur, ⁶ predominates over everything else.'

2. Esse in numero nullo potest, ‘cannot be held in any account.' So
λόγος is used in Greek, especially by Herodotus, cp. 1.120 λόγου οὐδενὸς
γινόμεθα. 3. 50 τοῦτο τὸ ἔπος ἐν οὐδενὶ λόγῳ ἐποιήσατο. 3. 120 σὺ ἑν
ἀνδρῶν λόγῳ; ⁴ are you a man ?'

3. Priinas, secundas, tertias; understand ‘partes,’ ‘the first, second,
third place? Demosthenes· emphatic sorm of expression has been often
imitated: the most famous instance perhaps is that of Damon, the Jacobin
leader in the French Revolution,when, describing the qualities required in a
revolution, he sayS, ‘ 11 nous faut de l'audace et encore de l’audace et toujours
de l’audace.’

5. Qo—solet‚ ‘and so Aeschines' well—known saying always (‘solet’)
seems to me all the better! ‘ Quo '= ‘et eo‚’ and is ablative of measure after
the comparative.

6. Propter ignominiam iudicii, ‘on account of the disgrace which he
incurred by the result of the trial.' Aeschines, in the action which he
brought against Ctesiphon, did not get a fifth part cf the votes, the result
of which was, that he incurred a fine of 1000 drachmae, and also partial
ἀτιμία, being deprived of the right of appearing as accuser again. ‘Iudicii '
is gen. of the object.

11. A Demosthene ς this was the famous speech known as the De
Corona.

17. 1. Qui se—necesse est, ‘those who choose to make themselves
seared, must, in their turn, sear those by whom they are feared.’

2. Quid has no construction in the sentence, a second interrogative, ‘qum'
having superseded it. We may supply in thought ‘fecisses or some such
word.
